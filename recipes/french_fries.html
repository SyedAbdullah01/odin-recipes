    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>French fries are a classic, crispy, and golden snack loved by many around the world. Made from fresh potatoes,
        theyâ€™re sliced into thin strips and deep-fried until they achieve a perfect balance of a crunchy exterior and a
        soft, fluffy interior. The rich, salty flavor pairs wonderfully with a variety of dipping sauces, from ketchup
        to mayo. Whether enjoyed as a side dish with a burger or as a standalone treat, French fries offer a satisfying,
        savory experience that is both simple and irresistible.</p>
