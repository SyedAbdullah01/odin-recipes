    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>An omelette is a simple yet delicious dish, known for its versatility and satisfying taste. Made primarily from
        beaten eggs, it's cooked until golden and fluffy, often with a slight crisp edge. The beauty of an omelette lies
        in its ability to be customized with a variety of fillings such as cheese, herbs, vegetables, and meats. Whether
        it's a classic cheese omelette, a savory mushroom and spinach version, or a hearty breakfast style with bacon
        and tomatoes, each bite is a balance of tender eggs and flavorful fillings. The texture is light and airy on the
        inside, with a delicate, slightly crispy exterior, making it the perfect quick meal for any time of day.</p>
