    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a rich combination of meat, cheese, and
        sauce. To make it, start by cooking lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. In a separate pan,
        prepare a meat sauce by browning ground beef or sausage, then adding garlic, onions, tomato sauce, and seasoning
        with salt, pepper, and herbs like basil and oregano. For the cheese filling, mix ricotta cheese with egg,
        parsley, and Parmesan. To assemble the lasagna, layer the noodles in a baking dish, followed by the meat sauce,
        cheese mixture, and shredded mozzarella. Repeat these layers until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of
        mozzarella on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 375째F (190째C) for about 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden
        and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving for the perfect, hearty meal!</p>
